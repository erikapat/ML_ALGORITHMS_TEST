    "A very similar framework is skope-rules, a Python module that also extracts rules from ensembles. It differs in the way it learns the final rules: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, skope-rules remove low-performing rules, based on recall and precision thresholds. \n",
    "2. Then, duplicate and similar rules are removed by performing a selection based on the diversity of logical terms (variable + larger/smaller operator) and performance (F1-score) of the rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "This final step does not rely on using Lasso, but considers only the out-of-bag F1-score and the logical terms which form the rules."
